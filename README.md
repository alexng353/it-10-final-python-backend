# Python backend for my IT 10 Final project

Uses Serpapi and Selenium to scrape walmart and superstore prices and return json.

Code relies on a "config.json" in the root of the projet:

```json
{
    "api_key":"YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
}
```

Code also relies on [selenium being installed properly on the host machine](https://www.selenium.dev)
